				<h2>
					School Picker
				</h2>

				<p class="description"> College is a big deal nowadays, but I've noticed that there's a dearth of websites that allow a prospective college student to sort colleges by price, as well as student satisfaction. This inspired me to create this website with a simple UI to help teens and parents choose which college best suits their needs </p>

				<table id="schools" class="table-responsive">
					<caption> Here is the list of schools </caption>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th scope="col"> Name</th>
							<th scope="col"> Location</th>
							<th scope="col"> Undergraduate enrollment</th>
							<th scope="col"> Tuition </th>
							<th scope="col"> Acceptance rate</th>
							<th scope="col"> U.S. News ranking</th>
							<th scope="col"> Public/private?</th>
							<th scope="col"> Student satisfaction</th>

						</tr>
					</thead>
				</table>
				
				<p class="functionality">
					<label for="sort"> Sort by: </label>
					<select name="sortingMethod" id="sort">
						<option value="price"> Price </option>
						<option value="size"> Undergrad size </option>
						<option value="acceptanceRate"> Acceptance Rate </option>
						<option value="rank"> U.S. News Rank </option>
						<option value="satisfaction"> Student satisfaction </option>
					</select>

					<label for="increasing"> Order by:</label>
						<label><input type="radio" name="increasing-decreasing" value="increasing" id="increasing" checked="checked" /> increasing
						<label><input type="radio" name="increasing-decreasing" value="decreasing" /> decreasing
					

					<button type="button" id="sortBtn" class="btn-primary"> Sort! </button>
				</p>
				

				<div class="improvements" > 
					<p> While implementing this project, I noticed there are many features that could be improved. For example:</p>
					<ul> 
						<li>Storing the schools in an actual database, instead of having the entire data in my javascript file </li>
						<li> If the schools were in a database, I could use the auto-increment attribute of SQL (applying it to the school's ranking) to easily add a new school </li>
						<li> Right now my student statisfaction column is based upon a school's freshman retention rate (i.e. the percentage of freshman who return for their sophomore year). Obviously this isn't the best indicator of a school's student statisfaction, as a freshman may not return for a variety of reasons (from lack of money to family issues). This shows that a better way of measuring student satisfaction, perhaps by taking in student input on a variety of topics (stress level, accessiblity of campus health, balance of social and school life) is needed.</li>
						<li> To turn this into a full-fledged web applicaton, I could have a username and login (and store that in a database), have users write reviews for each school, etc. </li>
					</ul>
